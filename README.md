# Motivation

This project examines whether higher transfer spending leads to better team performance in the English Premier League. Football clubs invest significant amounts of money in player transfers, and this study aims to understand if this investment translates into success on the field.

# Research Questions

Is there a relationship between transfer spending and team performance?

Do high-spending teams perform significantly better than low-spending teams?

Can team performance be partially predicted using transfer spending and club statistics?

# Data

All datasets used in this project were obtained from Kaggle and are already included in this GitHub repository.
The data consists of Premier League transfer spending data and Premier League club statistics for the 2020–2023 seasons.
All data files are stored in the data folder.

# Methodology

The project follows these steps:

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation analysis and hypothesis testing

Machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression

# Key Findings

Transfer spending shows a moderate positive correlation with league performance.

Teams with higher transfer spending generally finish higher in the league table.

Machine learning models can partially predict performance tiers based on spending and team statistics.

# Limitations and Future Work

The analysis is limited to a small number of seasons.

Important factors such as player wages, injuries, and managerial changes are not included.

Future work could extend the dataset and include player-level or financial variables.
