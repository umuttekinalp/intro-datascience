PREMIER LEAGUE MATCH STATISTICS AND MATCH OUTCOME ANALYSIS

Project Proposal:
This project aims to analyze football match statistics from the English Premier League to understand which factors have the strongest influence on match outcomes (home win, draw, away win).
The goal is to explore how different performance metrics such as shots, shots on target, ball possession, and passing accuracy correlate with the final match result. By conducting exploratory data analysis, I hope to identify the key indicators that increase the likelihood of winning a match.

Data Description:
Home team and away team, Goals scored, Shots and shots on target, Fouls and cards, Corners, Possession percentage, Pass accuracy, Match result.
The source is a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. This dataset provides clean, tabular CSV files that are straightforward to load and analyze.

Data Collection Plan:
Download the dataset directly from Kaggle, Load the data into Python using Pandas, Perform data cleaning, Conduct exploratory data analysis.

Planned Outcome:
The final deliverables will include a summary of which match statistics influence results the most, visualizations that demonstrate relationships between key variables, interpretations and insights explaining winning patterns in Premier League football.
