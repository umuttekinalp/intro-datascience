# Premier League Transfer Spending vs Team Performance

## Umut Tekinalp - 31137
### DSA210 Introduction to Data Science — Term Project

Using publicly available transfer data and season-level club statistics, the project examines
the relationship between transfer spending and team performance metrics such as goals scored,
goals conceded, and goal difference.

The analysis is conducted on a **season-by-season basis** (2020/2021–2022/2023) to account for
changes in participating teams across seasons.

### What this project includes
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Merging transfer spending data with season-level club performance data  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualizations  
- Correlation analysis and hypothesis testing  
- Simple machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)  
- Discussion of findings, limitations, and future work  

### Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

### Notes
Transfer spending is measured using the recorded transfer fees available in the dataset.
Some transfers (e.g., free transfers or undisclosed fees) may not be fully captured.
The machine learning models are used for exploratory purposes rather than predictive accuracy.
